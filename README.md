# docker
This is a collection of my docker files. Some of these are tweaked to my needs with little documentation as to why they are the way they are.

Some, if not most of these containers are geared towards my home entertainment. My current setup is to use Sonarr to scrape for TV shows, Couchpotato to grab movies, nzbget to actually download them and Plex to play them.

**My Setup**
All are able to run comfortably on an old Dell E6440 with 16GB of RAM, with lots of processor power and RAM to spare.

Storage, for now is on an old Mac Mini with a couple of NFS exports.

# Installation
Most of my dockers have a docker-compose files for a quick setup

If there are issues, let me know.
