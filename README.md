# docker
This is a collection of my docker files. Some of these are tweaked to my needs with little documentation as to why they are the way they are.

Some, if not most of these containers are geared towards my home entertainment. My current setup is to use Sonarr to scrape for TV shows, Couchpotato to grab movies, nzbget to actually download them and Plex to play them.

I have also included my minecraft server build. I need to find a way of auto updating the server since Mojang doesn't offer a nice and easy "latest" download package.

**My Setup**
All are able to run comfortably on an old Dell E6440 with 16GB of RAM, with lots of processor power and RAM to spare.

Storage is run from an external storage bay using logical volumes for future expansions.

# Installation
Most of my dockers have a docker-compose files for a quick setup

If there are issues, let me know.
